# Masonry Grid Layout

This is a simple example of a **masonry** grid layout. A masonry is a grid layout where the items are laid out in a way that minimizes the gaps between the items. The items are laid out in a way that mimics the way bricks are laid out in a wall. [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) is a good example of a masonry layout.
